This belongs in the hpc.social family of blogs. In particular, this is an aggregated feed of personal posts that meet the following criteria:

> The personal blogs aggregator is the "soul" of the HPC community - HPCers who are personally invested in the minutiae of the work they are doing, the projects they are working on with some content about their culture and pet pictures :D - things that we all find in common and share and talk about.

The hpc.social blogs aims to share ideas, news, and stories from diverse people, centers and groups across the High Performance Computing (HPC) community.
Whether you are an advanced practitioner, a developer that touches HPC, or a novice, your voice is welcome here. This community blog reflects exactly that - a syndicated feed of our community voices. It's one places that you can subscribe to via a variety of channels (below) and also <a href="https://github.com/hpc-social/personal-blog" target="_blank">follow instructions to contribute your own feed</a>.
